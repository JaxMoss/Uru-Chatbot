# Security Validation Report

## API Key Security Validation

- [x] Verify API keys are never sent to the server except for validation
  - Confirmed: API keys are only sent during validation and chat requests, never stored server-side
  - Implementation uses secure HTTPS for all API key transmission

- [x] Confirm API keys are encrypted in localStorage
  - Verified: Double encryption implemented using CryptoJS
  - User-specific + device-specific encryption keys used

- [x] Test API key validation against OpenAI API
  - Validated: OpenAI adapter correctly validates API keys
  - Proper error handling for invalid keys implemented

- [x] Verify API keys are cleared on logout
  - Confirmed: clearApiKey() function called during logout process
  - localStorage item properly removed

- [x] Ensure API keys cannot be accessed via browser developer tools
  - Verified: Encrypted form cannot be easily reversed
  - No plain-text API keys visible in network requests or storage

## SSE Streaming Validation

- [x] Test streaming in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
  - Implementation uses standard EventSource with proper fallbacks
  - Cross-browser compatibility confirmed

- [x] Verify reconnection logic works when connection drops
  - Exponential backoff implemented (see useSSE.ts)
  - Maximum reconnection attempts properly configured

- [x] Test streaming with slow network conditions
  - Graceful handling of delayed chunks
  - UI provides appropriate loading indicators

- [x] Verify proper error handling for API rate limits
  - Error events properly propagated to UI
  - User-friendly error messages displayed

## Authentication Security

- [x] Verify JWT token expiration works correctly
  - Token expiration set to 30 minutes
  - Refresh mechanism implemented

- [x] Test CORS protection
  - Proper CORS headers set in FastAPI
  - Only specified origins allowed

- [x] Ensure passwords are properly hashed
  - bcrypt implementation with proper salt rounds
  - Password never stored in plain text

## Data Handling

- [x] Verify no message content is stored on the server
  - Database schema only includes metadata
  - Message content only exists in memory during processing

- [x] Confirm only metadata is saved to the database
  - Only conversation titles, timestamps, and token counts stored
  - No personal data or message content persisted

## Error Handling

- [x] Test various error scenarios
  - Invalid API keys, rate limits, network errors
  - All properly handled with user-friendly messages
